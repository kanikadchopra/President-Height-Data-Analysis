# President-Height-Data-Analysis
My code for analyzing data on US President Heights to create summary statistics, look at quantiles (25th, median, 75th) and create a histogram to visualize the data.

Tools Used: Python - pandas, NumPy, matplotlib

pandas: used to import the csv file containing the data with the US president heights
numpy: used for summary statistics and to determine the heights at the 25th, 50th and 75th quantile
matplotlib: used to visualize the data on a histogram; included giving the histogram a title and labeling the axes
